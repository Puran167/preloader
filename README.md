<h1>What Is a Preloader?</h1>
<p>A preloader — or what some call a loading screen — is the what you see on some sites before the main content of the web page is loaded. Preloaders can be anything! They can be super simple or animation-laden.</p>

<p>A preloader’s job is to buy you those few extra seconds of patience from an easily distracted user base as they are actively interacting with your website or web page. Even a simple CSS loader can keep the momentum going in the customer’s decision-making process, preventing them from leaving the page!
